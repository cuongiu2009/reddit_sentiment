Sometimes, he talks longer than the video length. \n\nHate the game, not the player.

You're already doing a lot of this but I'd lean into it more. \n\nYouTube has changed in the past year or so. What I'm seeing is you need to feed the algorithm more of what it wants.

Like, maybe your explanation is a spike in zombie novel publications, or how \"the last of us\" tv show inspired indie devs, or how Last of Us proved to big studios that zombie games are easily monetizeable, or how post apocalypse stories cycle in and out of coolness, etc.\n\n\"Everything has been done in zombie games. Or has it?\" And the video would be an overview of zombie game troupes, and then dive into  the interesting mechanics coming out in 2025's crop of zombie games. Which is still 80% a list, but it asks a question and let's you build a narrative.\n\nOr like \"Why 2005 was the best year in gaming,\" and it could still be a video that's mostly a list of the best games from that year, but you'd also make a bit of a narrative as to why that year produced so many good games. (And you'd include an explanation, ala, \"after X game did well, studios invested far more money into crafting 3d worlds to keep up\".)\n\nThose videos could both be mostly list videos, but they're framed in a way that strikes my curiosity.",

Sad to say it, but they are mostly just gameplay with no voiceover. At that point, it's just like watching a game demo. There's no reason to come back to the channel. You're not imparting your personality, your perspective, your expertise, etc.\n\n\\- Your \"Top X\" videos don't have any commentary as to WHY those games are on the top list. They are against, mostly just a minute or two demo of every game on the list. And 20-40 minutes of game demos is a lot to ask of someone when there's basically no engagement with the viewer.\n\n\\- Several of the thumbnails an titles aren't clear on what the game is, what type of game it is, and or what's actually different or enticing about the game. \"This Looks Awesome\" with \"This Open World Game Looks Crazy\" doesn't really do much to entice the click. i even clicked on the video and I was almost two minutes in with no idea of what game I'm even looking at.\n\n\\- The other issue is game selection. A lot of these are games I've not heard of and as far as I can tell aren't getting a lot of press nor have significant advertising budgets. That means there aren't clicks to be had with people not even searching for things they don't know exist. This is part of the nature of the video game industry with PILES of good titles coming out every month that draw attention.\n\n\\- Looks like a lot of your biggest hits came during the pandemic and have slowly trailed off since, until the bit dropoff. Everyone's views were inflated to one level or another 2-5 years ago because viewers had way more time to watch stuff.\n\n\\- There are a LOT more people in the YouTube scene even over the past 2-3 years, but definitely compared to 5 years ago. Not to mention shorts and other things drawing folks attention.\n\n\\- Amazingly, you seem to still have a video or two a month that pop off for a 6 figure figure number of views and several in the 5 figures. So, I wouldn't say that you've been totally forsaken by the algorithm and your audience luckily.\n\nCould this be fixed and get back to some consistently larger number of views, yes. I don't think this is a dire situation. It will just take some focus and planning to up the packaging on the videos and how they are produced.\n\nEdit: I would also ad that with all the AI content popping up, it could be a combination of viewers getting board with that style and YouTube not sharing that style as much. Those are getting much lower engagement these days and YouTube has been pushing videos with high viewer satisfaction metrics as that keep people on the platform longer so they can sell more ad views. Not saying your stuff is all made with AI, but it has that feel.",

Maybe I'm an outlier, but modern gaming seems a lot more boring to me right now, and so I'm a lot less interested in videos about it at the moment.",

Thats my 2 cents on this but the videos you’ve been making are a lot more dry on the recent. It feels like you’ve just been mass producing the videos rather than making quality ones",

I'll tell you about my story, and maybe you'll identify with it. My channel died overnight in mid-March. All the new videos I upload have a watchtime of 95%-99% of subscribers, and after exactly 72 hours mark, my content gains a little more traction, but far from what it used to have before mid-March. It's as if my views were capped, not being recommended to the broad audience it used to be. To give you an idea, the last video I uploaded before the collapse had 60K views, and now it's barely 5k-6k. If the problem is the content, as many people here point out, I think your drop in views would be more gradual, but with an already established, authoritative channel, these things shouldn't happen overnight. By any chance, have you made any changes to your channel, for example, making some videos private or deleting them or changing your profile information?  I've seen many cases where the drop occurs after some sudden change in your channel and the system interprets it as a red flag.",

You might want to listen to some of it. \n\nOne thing I can tell you about posts is that the algorithm favors photos with no writing on them. So instead of your full thumbnail with the writing on it, try images without writing on it - and use authentic photos not AI generated. They will typically get the best reach. \n\nI suggest you try doing more shorts to help people lead to your content. I know some people are fully against shorts - they think it messes with their algorithm, but the fact is that shorts run on a completely different algorithm than your long form video. \n\nThe referred video option on the short gets very little click through. I manage several channels and across the board the CTR is typically 2% or less on the Related Video link. Shorts can do well for bringing new eyes due to the test audience being serviced first.\n\nAnd one last thing is that highly suggest you take the bit.ly out of your description. Just put your channel link for subs. YouTube has really frowned on short links that could potentially lead to dangerous content. In another instance, if you have a linktree don't use the shortened version of it (with the linktr.ee), type out the full URL (linktree.com). I have found these small changes have helped with reach.",

And that’s that the HD version takes longer to process.   That means if you post a video manually, there’s a chance that the first viewers are going to get a poor viewing experience as they are served an SD copy of the video and not the HD copy.\n\nAnother reason is that if you schedule videos ahead of time, there’s time for the system to check monetization, there’s time for copyright checks to be run and you actually have time to react and be able to correct things or take the video down if there’s a problem before it goes live.  \n\nI guarantee you that more than 90% of serious creators are scheduling their content out ahead of time",

I posted one video on a topic that I'm really passionate about, and it managed to generate 4,000 views and 1,000 watch hours pretty quickly (all of my content is long-form, I have made a few videos in the 10-25 minute range, but 90% of my videos are over 45 minutes, and some last for over two hours).\n\nAfter that, I realised that I could do something on the platform, so I thought that I would make a few more videos. They didn't do as well, but I was getting consistent four-figure views, so I thought that I'd try to make YouTube into something. I started with zero experience and knowledge, but an enormous amount of passion for the subject, and a lot of knowledge of that subject. I have very minimal video editing and creation skills, but a lot of experience as a published writer and author.\n\nI also posted a couple of videos at the start and then couldn't post again for ten days, so I don't recommend that approach! These are my stats for the last 90 days, which covers everything other than those two initial videos:\n\nVideos: 36\n\nViews: 109,000\n\nImpressions: 1.1 million\n\nCTR: 6.4%\n\nAverage view duration: 12:36\n\nSubscribers: 1,427\n\nWatch hours: 22,935\n\nIf you have any questions, please ask.",

They consume our content primarily via browse, search, and suggestion impressions.  If you don't believe me check your impression sources, 'channel page' impressions are generally a rounding error compared to the rest.\n\nI'm not saying having a goal of regular videos is bad, it's certainly good to keep one moving, but one should not expect a tangible benefit from the algorithm.\n\nThat said, much of the rest of what you've said rings true.\n\nThough posting manually is silly, you want to give your HD versions time to process so people get the best experience.\n\n  \nYou also should take the time to set up manual captions, a surprisingly high number of people use them, and I believe it may even help the algorithm understand words in the script that it might mishear at first.",

          "text": "Thank you for sharing your insights, it's very interesting to see other peoples perspectives. But I have to admit I don't agree with a lot of what you said. I'm not saying your wrong, these are just my opinions on the topic:\n\n1.  **A back catalogue:** while its nice having one (and as an established creator you should have one), as a new youtuber your primary goal should be to post -&gt; get feedback (views, likes, dislikes, comments) -&gt; iterate and improve.\n2.  **Regular schedule:** posting daily is not an option for most channels and I'd actually advise against it. If you're putting in less than 8h of work per video then either they are low quality or you have something special that others don't and can validate the \"lower effort\" with. Eg: you have a podcast and your guests are famous, you are famous, you have a very high skill in a certain field and can provide high value (a seasoned software dev, VFX artist, whatever). Focus on quality not quantity and providing value and the views will come.\n3.  **Post manually:** there is esentially no difference, scheduled posts are just a tool.\n4.  **Upload overnight:** maybe I just have fast internet but, what? Why? Uploades take 15 minutes usually.\n5.  **Don't go live until you're established:** I wouldn't say its a negative but livestreaming and youtube videos are two completely different skills so don't go live if you don't want to be a livestreamer.\n6.  **Be the best** ✅\n7.  **Best thumbnails you can do** ✅\n8.  **Youtube title checker:** most have been pretty useless to me and feel like AI slop but overall ✅ there is a correlation between title length and CTR\n9.  **YouTube tag generator:** nothing wrong with it again but tags have mostly been phased out by better algorithms, title+thumbnail embeddings, transcript embeddings etc. cant hurt though ✅\n10. **Description is important:** ✅\n11. **Use online tools to help with chapters** ✅ i give my transcript to chatgpt then manually clean up a bit\n12. **End screen** ✅\n13. **Complete fields** ✅\n14. **Answer comments** ✅\n15. **Listen to feedback** ✅ ✅ ✅ ✅ feedback is your best friend and you want as much of it as possible, this applies to not only comments but also analytics, CTR is feedback that your thumbnail+title is bad or your topic is bad. Retention graphs, etc. yes 100 times\n16. **Posts** ✅\n17. **And the last few points also** ✅",

And above all who wants to be open to discussion.\nI think it will help a lot of people.\nI pretty much agree with everything you say except for the scheduling of video releases. But I understand that manual mode is more of a habit than anything else for you in the end.\nAnd regarding the lives I don't agree either. Since January I have been doing a live at 7 p.m. every Wednesday. Sometimes I don't have a lot of people, but I have a lot of people watching the replay. So it's cool even if I prefer it to be during the live performance. But I have quite a few views generated thanks to the live rebroadcast. So I think that can be a strength for the content creator.\nPersonally I post 1 video every Friday 6 p.m.\nI also release 1 short format video every day at 8 a.m. on YouTube, Instagram, TikTok, Facebook.\nAnd I have short or long content that can also be released 😊\nAnd I have a community of around 5000 subscribers \nI would like to take this opportunity to ask a question in which category do you put your videos?\nI cover music, the music industry, cinema and other subjects. \nPersonally, I mainly use the music category.\nBut I have long wondered if I should go into entertainment or blog &amp; People or even education for certain videos.\n\nSo don't hesitate to tell me the category you use and if you have any information on the importance and usefulness of using it 😊",

I know it's not, there are a million products you mentioned, and nobody pays to sponsor reddit posts. But I was halfway expecting you to say \"thanks to &lt;x,y,z&gt; for sponsoring this post.\"\n\nAnd a side note about consistency, it's generally better to only upload when you actually hsve a good video idea then to be rigid about an upload schedule.  Sometimes it just takes longer to come up with good content, nothing wrong with taking a bit more time if you need it. Consistency is more about consistent quality and consistently delivering a similar feeling people get from watching your content. Doesn't mean you need to impose a strict schedule on yourself.",

Also, I'm a horrible youtuber in terms of releases and consistency. HOWEVER, I've made millions of a dollars because of the content on the YouTube channel. My content is focused on teaching Japanese and I have a textbook series that is super popular and I've invested a ton into our subscription website. HOWEVER, it wasn't until I started making the videos that the books and website sold so well. My channel sucks frankly, but enough people buy the books so that I've not had to work a job for 15+ years. So, I think the key is the have another product that people can purchase that has value.\n\nThat being said... creating such a project is a huge commitment and might not even work out despite max effort.   \nThe other thing that works for my daughter, who has 330k subs is sponsorship deals. That's a lot of work as well and you can have good months and bad. I personally have never had any sponsorships since I'm essentially my own sponsor. But perhaps you could start offering interesting merch that your fans would be interested in buying while also learning more about sponsorships.",

How often the live streams happen could be a factor too, like if he streamed 10x a day or every single day, he might have gotten significantly less in tips.
