# Feature Specification: Sentiment Analysis Application

**Feature Branch**: `001-use-sentiment-app`
**Created**: 2025-09-18
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "use @sentiment_app_react_single_file.jsx to T·∫°o ra 1 ·ª©ng d·ª•ng ph√¢n t√≠ch c·∫£m x√∫c t·ª´ ng·ªØ d·ª±a tr√™n c√°c √Ω ki·∫øn t·ª´ ng∆∞·ªùi d√πng kh·∫Øp m·∫°ng x√£ h·ªôi, khi m·ªôt ch·ªß ƒë·ªÅ ƒë∆∞·ª£c ch·ªçn th√¨ s·∫Ω c√≥ thu·∫≠t to√°n crawl h·∫øt t·∫•t c·∫£ c√°c d·ªØ li·ªáu li√™n quan ƒë·∫øn topic ƒë√≥, sau ƒë√≥ th√¨ AI s·∫Ω ph√¢n t√≠ch xem t·ª´ n√†y ƒë∆∞·ª£c nh·∫Øc ƒë·∫øn v·ªõi th√°i ƒë·ªô nh∆∞ th·∫ø n√†o.

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors (user), actions (choose topic, view sentiment), data (social media opinions, sentiment results), constraints (user-friendly UI)
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user, I want to enter a topic to discover a few popular posts (e.g., on Twitter, Reddit, YouTube) and then analyze the sentiment of the **comments** underneath those posts, so that I can understand the diverse opinions within those specific conversations.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1.  **Given** I am on the sentiment analysis homepage, **When** I enter a topic and click "Analyze", **Then** the system should find a set of popular parent posts and analyze the comments found within them.
2.  **Given** the sentiment results are displayed, **When** I view the overview, **Then** I should see a sentiment breakdown (Positive, Neutral, Negative) based on the collected comments.
3.  **Given** the sentiment results are displayed, **When** I look for more details, **Then** I should see a word cloud and top mentions derived from the comment data.
4.  **Given** no relevant parent posts or comments can be found for a topic, **When** I click "Analyze", **Then** the system should display a message indicating that not enough data could be found.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the user enters a very long or nonsensical topic?
- The primary supported language for analysis is **Vietnamese**. Support for other languages will be considered in future iterations.
- What happens if the API fails while fetching comments for one of the parent posts?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The system MUST provide an input field for users to enter a topic or keyword.
- **FR-002**: The system MUST allow users to select one or more social media sources (including Twitter/X, Reddit, YouTube).
- **FR-003**: The system MUST allow users to select a time range for finding relevant parent posts.
- **FR-004**: The system MUST, upon submission, first identify a configurable set of popular "parent" posts from the selected sources (e.g., 10 posts).
- **FR-005**: The system MUST then crawl a configurable number of comments from each of those parent posts (e.g., 100 comments per post) to create a dataset of ~1000 comments.
- **FR-006**: The system MUST use an AI model to analyze the text of the collected **comments**.
- **FR-007**: The system MUST display the sentiment analysis results based on the comments, including an overview, net score, word cloud, and top mentions.
- **FR-008**: The user interface MUST be user-friendly and easy to navigate, following the layout provided in the `sentiment_app_react_single_file.jsx` prototype.
- **FR-009**: The system MUST handle cases where no data is found and inform the user clearly.
- **FR-010**: The system SHOULD provide placeholders for filtering options on the results page. [NOTE: The implementation of the filtering logic is deferred to a future iteration.]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Topic**: Represents the subject of the sentiment analysis. Attributes: name/keyword.
- **Analysis Job**: Represents a user's request for sentiment analysis. Attributes: topic, selected_sources, time_range.
- **Parent Post**: Represents a top-level post (e.g., a Tweet, Reddit submission, YouTube video) identified as a source for comments. Attributes: source, url, title/text.
- **Comment**: Represents a single comment crawled from a Parent Post. This is the document to be analyzed. Attributes: content, author, source, timestamp, sentiment.
- **Sentiment Result**: Represents the outcome of the analysis for a given job. Attributes: summary, net_score, timeline_data, top_mentions, top_words.
